# India-Suicide-Data-Project
A project to consolidate the NCRB data to make meaningful decisions about suicide prevention

Context:
In India, suicide represents a significant public health challenge. The National Crime Records Bureau releases annual suicide statistics. These are generally released in the form of long pdf reports, often making it challenging for researchers to work with and explore state level factors that contribute to suicide risk. There is also a noticeable lack of district-level data. Improving access to this data can improve its utilization, potentially enhance the understanding and planning of interventions aimed at suicide prevention.

Methods:
This project is attempting to create  novel system for data extraction  using APIs from data.gov.in and the National Data Analytics Platform(NDAP). This data will be subsequently integrated into an RShiny application, allowing researchers to delve deeper into state-level indicators that might influence suicide rates in India. The application will also provide a platform for individual researchers to come together and collate district-level data by filing Right to Information appleas.
